Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) represent the causal relationship between genes regulating
cellular functions (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Blais and Dynlacht, 2005). GRNs play important
roles in cellular regulatory systems such as signal transduction and transcriptional regulation, which
underlie almost all cellular phenomena. Therefore, comprehensive GRN maps are essential tools to
elucidate gene function, thereby facilitating interpretations of biological processes, such as cellular
differentiation and response to environmental stimuli at system-level (Lopez-Maury et al., 2008),
and enabling the identification and prioritization of candidates of genes for molecular regulators
and biomarkers (van Dam et al., 2018).
